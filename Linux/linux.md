<h2 id="what-is-linux"><strong>What is Linux</strong></h2>
<p>Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qKE6nif.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
<h2 id="how-does-linux-differ-from-other-operating-systems"><strong>How does Linux differ from other operating systems?</strong></h2>
<p>In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and the same types of software you are accustomed to, such as word processors, photo editors, video editors, and so on. In many cases, a software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. In short: if you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.</p>
<p>But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.</p>
<p>Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many  <em>distributions</em>  of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components.</p>
<h2 id="who-uses-linux"><strong>Who uses Linux?</strong></h2>
<p>You probably already use Linux, whether you know it or not. Depending on which user survey you look at, between one- and two-thirds of the webpages on the Internet are generated by servers running Linux.</p>
<p>Companies and individuals choose Linux for their servers because it’s secure, flexible, and you can receive excellent support from a large community of users, in addition to companies like Canonical, SUSE, and Red Hat, each of which offer commercial support.</p>
<p>Many devices you probably own, such as Android phones and tablets and Chromebooks, digital storage devices, personal video recorders, cameras, wearables, and more, also run Linux. Your car has Linux running under the hood. Even Microsoft Windows features Linux components, as part of the  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-unix-and-linux"><strong>What is the difference between Unix and Linux?</strong></h2>
<p>You may have heard of Unix, which is an operating system developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Unix and Linux are similar in many ways, and in fact, Linux was originally created to be indistinguishable from Unix. Both have similar tools for interfacing with the system, programming tools, filesystem layouts, and other key components. However, not all Unices are free and open source.</p>
<p>Over the years, a number of different operating systems have been created that attempted to be “unix-like” or “unix-compatible,” but Linux has been the most successful, far surpassing its predecessors in popularity.</p>
<h2 id="installation-of-linux"><strong>Installation of Linux</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Installing Linux by using virtual box</li>
</ul>
<p>Before installing the virtual box first we need to install  chocolatey(for Windows) or honeybrew(for Macos) software management automation for Windows or Macos that wraps installers, executables, zips, and scripts into compiled packages.</p>
<p>For Windows Run the following commands in Powershell. Source-<a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">chocolatey installation</a> .</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Run  <code>Get-ExecutionPolicy</code>.<br>
If it returns  <code>Restricted</code>,<br>
Then run  <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned</code>  or<br>
<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>1. Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex
    ((New-Object
    System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    
      
 2. choco install virtualbox
</code></pre>
<p>For Macos go through the Source url and Run the commands in your Terminal.<br>
Source-<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation">honeybrew installation</a>.<br>
And after installing honeybrew type the below command</p>
<pre><code>brew install --cask vagrant
</code></pre>
<h2 id="introduction-to-linux-distribution">Introduction to Linux Distribution</h2>
<p>Other operating systems like Microsoft combine each bit of codes internally and release it as a single package. You have to choose from one of the version they offer.</p>
<p>But Linux is different from them. Different parts of Linux are developed by different organizations.</p>
<p>Different parts include kernel, shell utilities, X server, system environment, graphical programs, etc. If you want you can access the codes of all these parts and assemble them yourself. But its not an easy task seeking a lot of time and all the parts has to be assembled correctly in order to work properly.</p>
<p>From here on distribution (also called as distros) comes into the picture. They assemble all these parts for us and give us a compiled operating system of Linux to install and use.</p>
<h2 id="distributions-of-linux"><strong>Distributions of Linux</strong></h2>
<h3 id="why-to-use">Why To Use</h3>
<p><strong>UBuntu</strong>-It works like Mac OS and easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Linux mint</strong>-It works like windows and should be use by new comers.</p>
<p><strong>Debian</strong>-It provides stability but not recommended to a new user.</p>
<p><strong>Fedora</strong>-If you want to use red hat and latest software.</p>
<p><strong>Red hat enterprise</strong>-To be used commercially.</p>
<p><strong>CentOS</strong>-If you want to use red hat but without its trademark.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSUSE</strong>-It works same as Fedora but slightly older and more stable.</p>
<p><strong>Arch Linux</strong>-It is not for the beginners because every package has to be installed by yourself.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-linux-file-system">What is <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-system">Linux File system</a></h2>
<p>Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the data management of the storage. It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/ (root filesystem):</strong>  It is the top-level filesystem directory. It must include every file needed to boot the Linux system before another filesystem is mounted. Every other filesystem is mounted on a well-defined and standard mount point because of the root filesystem directories after the system is started.</li>
<li><strong>/boot:</strong>  It includes the static kernel and bootloader configuration and executable files needed to start a Linux computer.</li>
<li><strong>/bin:</strong>  This directory includes user executable files.</li>
<li><strong>/dev:</strong>  It includes the device file for all hardware devices connected to the system. These aren’t device drivers; instead, they are files that indicate all devices on the system and provide access to these devices.</li>
<li><strong>/etc:</strong>  It includes the local system configuration files for the host system.</li>
<li><strong>/lib:</strong>  It includes shared library files that are needed to start the system.</li>
<li><strong>/home:</strong>  The home directory storage is available for user files. All users have a subdirectory inside /home.</li>
<li><strong>/mnt:</strong>  It is a temporary mount point for basic filesystems that can be used at the time when the administrator is working or repairing a filesystem.</li>
<li><strong>/media:</strong>  A place for mounting external removable media devices like USB thumb drives that might be linked to the host.</li>
<li><strong>/opt:</strong>  It contains optional files like vendor supplied application programs that must be placed here.</li>
<li><strong>/root:</strong>  It’s the home directory for a root user. Keep in mind that it’s not the ‘/’ (root) file system.</li>
<li><strong>/tmp:</strong>  It is a temporary directory used by the OS and several programs for storing temporary files. Also, users may temporarily store files here. Remember that files may be removed without prior notice at any time in this directory.</li>
<li><strong>/sbin:</strong>  These are system binary files. They are executables utilized for system administration.</li>
<li><strong>/usr:</strong>  They are read-only and shareable files, including executable libraries and binaries, man files, and several documentation types.</li>
<li><strong>/var:</strong>  Here, variable data files are saved. It can contain things such as MySQL, log files, other database files, email inboxes, web server data files, and much more.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="linux-absolute-and-relative-paths">Linux Absolute and Relative Paths</h2>
<p>It is very important to know the difference between absolute and relative path. Because correct path will only lead you to your destination directory.</p>
<p>When you define a path starting with a slash (’/’) sign, then root of the file is assumed. If you don’t put a ‘/’ then the current directory is assumed to be the starting point.<br>
<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/bash-relative-vs-absolute-path">https://www.javatpoint.com/bash-relative-vs-absolute-path</a></p>
<h2 id="absolute-path">Absolute Path</h2>
<p>An  <strong>Absolute Path</strong>  is a full path specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory or start of the actual filesystem.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  /home/javatpoint/Desktop/CollegeStudent</p>
<h2 id="relative-path">Relative Path</h2>
<p><strong>The relative path</strong>  of a file is its location relative to the current working directory. It never starts with a slash (/). It begins with the ongoing work directory.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>/Desktop/CollegeStudent</p>
