  <div class="stackedit__html"><h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<p>Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer hardware platform, operating system, storage device, or network resources. This allows multiple instances of an operating system to run on a single physical machine, and it can be used to improve efficiency and save costs.</p>
<p>There are many different types of virtualization, but the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual machine (VM) virtualization:</strong>  This is the most common type of virtualization and it allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine. Each VM has its own operating system and applications, and it can be isolated from the other VMs.</li>
<li><strong>Container virtualization:</strong>  This type of virtualization allows multiple containers to run on a single physical machine. Containers are smaller and more lightweight than VMs, and they share the operating system of the host machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hosted virtualization:</strong>  This type of virtualization allows a hypervisor to run on top of an existing operating system. The hypervisor creates and manages the VMs, and it can be used to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>NFV (network function virtualization):</strong>  This type of virtualization allows network functions to be run on software. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtualization has many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>  Virtualization can help to improve efficiency by allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine. This can save space and reduce power consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong>  Virtualization can help to save costs by reducing the need for physical hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>  Virtualization can help to improve flexibility by allowing you to easily create and resize VMs. This can be useful for testing new applications or for accommodating spikes in demand.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Virtualization can help to improve security by isolating VMs from each other. This can help to prevent malware from spreading from one VM to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a way to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility of your IT infrastructure, then virtualization is a good option to consider.</p>
<p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer hardware platform, operating system, storage device, or network resources. This allows multiple instances of an operating system to run on a single physical machine, and it can be used to improve efficiency and save costs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of virtualization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong>  Virtualization can be complex to implement and manage. You need to have a good understanding of virtualization technology in order to get the most out of it.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Virtualization can introduce new security risks. For example, if a VM is compromised, it could potentially affect other VMs on the same physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong>  Virtualization can have a negative impact on performance. This is because the hypervisor needs to share the resources of the physical machine between the VMs.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong>  If you choose to use a proprietary hypervisor, you may be locked into that vendor’s products. This can make it difficult to switch to a different hypervisor in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="containerization">Containerization</h2>
<p>Containerization is a software virtualization technique that allows an application and its dependencies to be packaged into a standardized unit for deployment. This can be used to run applications consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.</p>
<p>Containers are similar to virtual machines (VMs) in that they both allow multiple applications to run on the same physical server. However, containers are much more lightweight than VMs, and they do not require a hypervisor. This makes them more efficient and easier to manage.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of containerization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>  Containers are more efficient than VMs because they do not require a hypervisor. This can save space and reduce power consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong>  Containers can be easily moved from one environment to another. This makes them ideal for development and testing, as well as for deploying applications in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>  Containers can be scaled easily by adding or removing containers as needed. This makes them ideal for applications that need to be able to handle spikes in demand.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Containers can be isolated from each other, which can help to prevent malware from spreading.</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong>  Containers can help to save costs by reducing the need for physical hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the challenges of containerization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong>  Containerization can be complex to implement and manage. You need to have a good understanding of container technology in order to get the most out of it.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Containerization can introduce new security risks. For example, if a container is compromised, it could potentially affect other containers on the same host.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong>  Containerization can have a negative impact on performance. This is because containers need to share the resources of the host machine.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong>  If you choose to use a proprietary container platform, you may be locked into that vendor’s products. This can make it difficult to switch to a different container platform in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, containerization is a powerful technology that can offer many benefits. However, it is important to be aware of the potential challenges before you decide to implement it.</p>
<p>Here are some of the popular containerization tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Docker is the most popular containerization tool. It is open source and free to use.</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes</strong>: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration tool. It is used to manage and deploy containers at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)</strong>: ECS is a managed container service from Amazon Web Services. It makes it easy to run and manage containers on AWS.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Container Service (AKS)</strong>: AKS is a managed container service from Microsoft Azure. It makes it easy to run and manage containers on Azure.</li>
<li><strong>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</strong>: GKE is a managed container service from Google Cloud Platform. It makes it easy to run and manage containers on Google Cloud Platform.</li>

<h2 id="docker-engine">Docker Engine</h2>
<p>Docker Engine is a free and open-source software platform that enables you to build, run, and share containerized applications. Containerization is a technique that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single unit for deployment.</p>
<p>Docker Engine consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Docker daemon:</strong> This is the core component of Docker Engine. It is responsible for running containers and managing the Docker image repository.</li>
<li><strong>The Docker client:</strong> This is a command-line tool that you can use to interact with the Docker daemon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Docker daemon is typically installed on a server, while the Docker client can be installed on any machine.</p>
<p>To use Docker Engine, you first need to create a Docker image. A Docker image is a blueprint for a container. It defines the software that will be included in the container, as well as the configuration of the container.</p>
<p>Once you have created a Docker image, you can run it as a container. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p>
<p>Docker Engine makes it easy to run containers on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It also makes it easy to share Docker images with others.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using Docker Engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong>  Docker images are portable, meaning that they can be run on any machine that has Docker Engine installed. This makes it easy to deploy applications to different environments.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>  Docker containers are lightweight, so they can be used to run applications that require fewer resources. This can help to save money on hardware costs.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>  Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down, making them ideal for applications that need to be able to handle spikes in demand.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Docker containers can be isolated from each other, which helps to prevent malware from spreading.</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong>  Docker Engine is free to use, so you can save money on software licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a way to deploy applications more easily and efficiently, then Docker Engine is a good option to consider.</p>
<h2 id="docker-image">Docker image</h2>
<p>A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p>
<p>Docker images are built on top of a base image, which is a pre-built image that provides common functionality. For example, there are base images for Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>
<p>To create a Docker image, you need to write a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for building the image. The Dockerfile specifies the base image, the software that should be installed in the image, and the configuration of the image.</p>
<p>Once you have created a Dockerfile, you can build the image using the docker build command. The docker build command creates a new image from the Dockerfile and stores it in a Docker repository.</p>
<p>You can then run the Docker image as a container. A container is a running instance of an image. To run a container, you use the docker run command.</p>
<p>Docker images are a powerful tool for deploying applications. They are portable, lightweight, and scalable. They can also be used to isolate applications from each other, which helps to improve security.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using Docker images:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong>  Docker images are portable, meaning that they can be run on any machine that has Docker Engine installed. This makes it easy to deploy applications to different environments.</li>

<p>Here are some of the differences between Docker images and Docker containers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An image is a blueprint for a container.</strong>  It defines the software that will be included in the container, as well as the configuration of the container.</li>
<li><strong>A container is a running instance of an image.</strong>  It  is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</li>
<li><strong>An image can be used to create multiple containers.</strong>  Each container will have its own unique state, but they will all share the same base image.</li>
<li><strong>Images are stored in a repository, while containers are run on a Docker daemon.</strong>  The Docker daemon is a program that manages Docker images and containers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="docker-container">Docker container</h2>
<p>A docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p>
<p>Containers are isolated from each other, so they can’t interfere with each other. This isolation makes containers a good choice for deploying applications in a shared environment, such as a cloud computing platform.</p>
<p>To create a Docker container, you need to have a Docker image. A Docker image is a blueprint for a container. It defines the software that will be included in the container, as well as the configuration of the container.</p>
<p>Once you have a Docker image, you can run it as a container using the docker run command. The docker run command creates a new container from the image and starts it running.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="docker-volume">Docker volume</h2>
<p>A Docker volume is a directory or file that is shared between one or more Docker containers. Volumes are mounted into containers at runtime, and they persist even when the containers are stopped or deleted.</p>
<p>Volumes are a good way to store data that needs to be shared between containers, such as configuration files, database data, or logs. They are also a good way to store data that needs to be persistent, such as data that should not be lost when a container is stopped or deleted.</p>
<p>There are two types of Docker volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Named volumes:</strong>  Named volumes are created and managed by Docker. They are persistent and can be shared by multiple containers.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous volumes:</strong>  Anonymous volumes are created and managed by the container. They are not persistent and are not shared by other containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a named volume, you can use the docker volume create command. The docker volume create command creates a new named volume and assigns it a name.</p>
<p>To mount a volume into a container, you can use the docker run command. The docker run command mounts the volume into the container at a specific location.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using Docker volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data persistence:</strong>  Volumes persist even when the containers are stopped or deleted. This means that the data in the volume will not be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Data sharing:</strong>  Volumes can be shared by multiple containers. This makes it easy to share data between containers.</li>
<li><strong>Data isolation:</strong>  Volumes are isolated from each other. This means that the data in one volume cannot be accessed by the data in another volume.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong>  Volumes can improve the performance of containers by reducing the amount of data that needs to be copied between the container and the host machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a way to store data that needs to be shared between containers, then Docker volumes are a good option to consider.</p>
<h2 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h2>
<p>A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for building a Docker image. It is a text file that contains a series of commands that tell Docker how to build the image.</p>
<p>The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image, which is a blueprint for a container. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p>
<p>The Dockerfile is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the building of Docker images. It can also be used to create reproducible images, which means that you can always rebuild the same image from the same Dockerfile.</p>
<p>The Dockerfile is a text file that is written in a specific format. The file starts with a FROM instruction, which specifies the base image for the image. The FROM instruction can be followed by a series of other instructions, such as RUN, CMD, and EXPOSE.</p>
<p>The RUN instruction is used to install software and run commands in the image. The CMD instruction is used to specify the command that will be run when the container is started. The EXPOSE instruction is used to specify the ports that will be exposed by the container.</p>
<p>The Dockerfile is a powerful tool that can be used to build Docker images. It is a good idea to learn how to use the Dockerfile if you are planning to use Docker.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using a Dockerfile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong>  Dockerfiles can be reused to build multiple images. This can save time and effort.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong>  Dockerfiles can be used to create reproducible images. This means that you can always rebuild the same image from the same Dockerfile.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>  Dockerfiles can be used to build scalable images. This means that you can easily create images that can be run on a variety of hardware platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Dockerfiles can be used to build secure images. This can be done by specifying the software that is installed in the image and by running commands to secure the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a way to build Docker images, then the Dockerfile is a good option to consider.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
<p>Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage <em>containers</em>—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">Containers</a> simplify development and delivery of distributed applications. They have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> development and hybrid <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> environments. It’s possible for developers to create containers without Docker, by working directly with capabilities built into Linux and other operating systems. But Docker makes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization">containerization</a> faster, easier and safer. At this writing, Docker reported over <a href="https://www.docker.com/">13 million developers using the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s understand the Docker containers and virtual machine</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YGOLdVl.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
<h3 id="docker-containers">Docker Containers</h3>
<p>Docker containers are the  <strong>lightweight</strong>  alternatives of the virtual machine. It allows developers to package up the application with all its libraries and dependencies, and ship it as a single package. The advantage of using a docker container is that you don’t need to allocate any RAM and disk space for the applications. It automatically generates storage and space according to the application requirement.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-machine">Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>A virtual machine is a software that allows us to install and use other operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Debian) simultaneously on our machine. The operating system in which virtual machine runs are called virtualized operating systems. These virtualized operating systems can run programs and preforms tasks that we perform in a real operating system.</p>
<h3 id="why-docker">Why docker</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong>  Containers are portable, meaning they can be moved from one environment to another without having to be rebuilt. This makes it easy to deploy applications to different servers, cloud platforms, and even on your own laptop.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong>  Containers ensure that applications run the same way in every environment. This is because each container contains everything the application needs to run, so there are no surprises when you deploy it to a new environment.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>  Containers are lightweight, so they use fewer resources than virtual machines. This can save you money on cloud hosting costs and make it easier to run applications on your own hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong>  Containers are isolated from each other, so they cannot access each other’s data or resources. This makes it more difficult for attackers to exploit security vulnerabilities in your applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for a way to package and run applications consistently across different environments, Docker is a great option. It is easy to use, efficient, and secure.</p>
<p>Here are some additional reasons why you might want to use Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong>  Docker containers can be started up quickly, which can save you time when deploying applications.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>  Docker containers can be scaled up or down easily, which makes it easy to handle fluctuating traffic loads.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>  Docker containers can be used to run a wide variety of applications, from simple web applications to complex distributed systems.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong>  There is a large and active community of Docker users and developers, which means that there is a lot of support available if you need it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-docker">Advantages of Docker</h2>
<p>There are the following advantages of Docker -</p>
<ul>
<li>It runs the container in seconds instead of minutes.</li>
<li>It uses less memory.</li>
<li>It provides lightweight virtualization.</li>
<li>It does not a require full operating system to run applications.</li>
<li>It uses application dependencies to reduce the risk.</li>
<li>Docker allows you to use a remote repository to share your container with others.</li>
<li>It provides continuous deployment and testing environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-docker">Disadvantages of Docker</h2>
<p>There are the following disadvantages of Docker -</p>
<ul>
<li>It increases complexity due to an additional layer.</li>
<li>In Docker, it is difficult to manage large amount of containers.</li>
<li>Some features such as container self -registration, containers self-inspects, copying files form host to the container, and more are missing in the Docker.</li>
<li>Docker is not a good solution for applications that require rich graphical interface.</li>
<li>Docker provides cross-platform compatibility means if an application is designed to run in a Docker container on Windows, then it can’t run on Linux or vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="docker-architecture">Docker architecture</h3>
<p>Docker follows Client-Server architecture, which includes the three main components that are  <strong>Docker Client</strong>,  <strong>Docker Host</strong>, and  <strong>Docker Registry</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="docker-client">1. Docker Client</h3>
<p>Docker client uses  <strong>commands</strong>  and  <strong>REST APIs</strong>  to communicate with the Docker Daemon (Server). When a client runs any docker command on the docker client terminal, the client terminal sends these docker commands to the Docker daemon. Docker daemon receives these commands from the docker client in the form of command and REST API’s request.<br>
Docker Client uses Command Line Interface (CLI) to run the following commands -</p>
<p>docker build</p>
<p>docker pull</p>
<p>docker run</p>
<h3 id="docker-host">2. Docker Host</h3>
<p>Docker Host is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications. It contains the docker daemon, images, containers, networks, and storage.</p>
<h3 id="docker-registry">3. Docker Registry</h3>
<p>Docker Registry manages and stores the Docker images.</p>
<p>There are two types of registries in the Docker -</p>
<p><strong>Pubic Registry -</strong>  Public Registry is also called as  <strong>Docker hub</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Private Registry -</strong>  It is used to share images within the enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="docker-images-and-docker-containers">Docker Images AND Docker Containers</h2>
<h3 id="docker-images">Docker Images</h3>
<p>Docker images are the  <strong>read-only binary templates</strong>  used to create Docker Containers. It uses a private container registry to share container images within the enterprise and also uses public container registry to share container images within the whole world. Metadata is also used by docket images to describe the container’s abilities.</p>
<h3 id="docker-containers-1">Docker Containers</h3>
<p>Containers are the structural units of Docker, which is used to hold the entire package that is needed to run the application. The advantage of containers is that it requires very less resources.</p>
<p>In other words, we can say that the image is a template, and the container is a copy of that template.</p>
<h2 id="installation-of-docker">Installation of Docker</h2>
<p><strong>Docker installation Ubuntu:</strong><br>
The Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu repository may not be the latest version. To ensure we get the latest version, we’ll install Docker from the official Docker repository. To do that, we’ll add a new package source, add the GPG key from Docker to ensure the downloads are valid, and then install the package.</p>
<p>First, update your existing list of packages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sudo apt update</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ai0okaT.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let <code>apt</code> use packages over HTTPS:<br>
<code>sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fj9tJci.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:<br>
<code>curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wmwyITd.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Add the Docker repository to APT sources:<br>
<code>sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5651AxH.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
This will also update our package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo.</p>
<p>Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:</p>
<p><code>apt-cache policy docker-ce</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5651AxH.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ll see output like this, although the version number for Docker may be different:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6MjXkRD.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Notice that  <code>docker-ce</code>  is not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 20.04 (<code>focal</code>).</p>

<p>Finally, install Docker:<br>
<code>sudo apt install docker-ce</code><br>

</blockquote>
<p>Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it’s running:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sudo systemctl status docker</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fJQygXF.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
The output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:<br>

Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also the <code>docker</code> command line utility, or the Docker client. We’ll explore how to use the <code>docker</code> command later in this tutorial.</p>

<p><strong>Docker installation CentOS:</strong><br>
The Docker installation package available in the official CentOS 7 repository may not be the latest version. To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.</p>
<p>But first, let’s update the package database:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sudo yum check-update</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FgCWgbm.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now run this command. It will add the official Docker repository, download the latest version of Docker, and install it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SgcVo4Q.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
After installation has completed, start the Docker daemon:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl start docker</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ndiQpO9.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Verify that it’s running:<br>
<code>sudo systemctl status docker</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LRS75nA.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
The output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/v2ofQmJ.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Lastly, make sure it starts at every server reboot:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl enable docker</code><br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9IQEmT.png" alt="Imgur"><br>
Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also the <code>docker</code> command line utility, or the Docker client. We’ll explore how to use the <code>docker</code> command later in this tutorial.</p>
